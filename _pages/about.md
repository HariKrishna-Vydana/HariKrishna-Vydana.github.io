I’m Hari Krishna Vydana, a Conversational AI researcher and machine learning enthusiast. Currently, I work as Tech Lead – Voice AI at Telepathy AI Labs, where I focus on developing Appointment.AI, an AI-powered system for seamless appointment scheduling. My work spans areas such as Agentic AI, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Dialog Management, Speech-to-Speech Translation, and Multimodal LLMs.

Before this, I had the opportunity to work at organizations like Huawei Technologies, Cerence, and the University of Cambridge, contributing to various research and development efforts in Conversational AI. My interest lies in bridging cutting-edge research with practical, real-world applications that make AI more accessible and impactful.

I hold a Ph.D. in Speech and Language Technology from IIIT Hyderabad, where I worked on developing integrated multilingual ASR systems for Indian language scenarios. My thesis, titled “Salient Features for Multilingual Speech Recognition in Indian Scenarios”, was supervised by [Dr. Anil Kumar Vuppala](https://sites.google.com/view/welcome-to-anils-world/academics).
